## Current computing paradigms

Generally, computers are thought of as single devices, as seen below:

Everyday devices fall under the *centralized* computing paradigm. This means that for each device, they have a local set of resources (memory, processor, I/O, graphics, storage). They are fully shared and tightly coupled, with unification achieved under one operating system.

## What is parallel computing?

In parallel computing, all processing nodes in a machine can be coupled in different ways
