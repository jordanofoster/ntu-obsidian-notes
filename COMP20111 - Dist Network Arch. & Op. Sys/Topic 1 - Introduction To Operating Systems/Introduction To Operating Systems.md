# Centralised Computing
- Centralized systems include PCs, laptops, etc.
	- Have **local resources** that are **CPU accessible**
		- **Fully shareable,** connected via OS
		-  Connected to **CPU** through **motherboard**
			- Internal components - via **data buses**
			- External peripherals - via **interfaces**

## Operating Systems
- **Collections of programs** that manage:
	- **Hardware resources**
	- **Connected peripherals**
	
- They provide:
	- **Resource Management**
	- **Machine extending**
		- *Abstraction of hardware from user*
	- **Concurrency
		- Several operations "simultaneously"
	- **Shared hardware resources**
	- **Long-term storage**
	- **Non-determinacy**
		- *Resistance to crashes from unpredicted events*
		- See *Byzantine Fault Tolerance*

- Removes **accessibility boundaries** from less technically literate
	- Eliminates boundary between *hardware and software*
	- Easy-to-use development/runtime environments
