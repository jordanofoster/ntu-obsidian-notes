# Introduction to Distributed Computing

## Computer Stack

From this point onwards, we will be looking at distributed applications and middleware built on top of a compute cluster.

## Converting our world from analogue to digital
When engineering parts of today's digital and highly distributed world, the following must be considered:
- Communication
	- And the infrastructure to enable it
- Complex systems & Software Services
- Emerging fields including quantum computing and other advancements such as decentralized computing

### Communicating

One of the main questions for a systems engineer is how to enable the communication and flow of data between people and devices. The internet is comprised of many networks that are linked via a number of key pipelines, that connect geographical areas. Engineers need to determine how best to manage and allow these networks to grow, and continue to efficiently transmit information. This includes consideration of the following:
- Aspects of infrastructure
	- Such as networking switches, cables, radio (wireless), bandwidth, security, etc.
- Protocols, old and new
- Scalability of our implementations
- Software systems
- Provided services

This is by no means an exhaustive list and there are many other factors to consider.

### Complex Systems

Large interconnected networks are naturally extremely complex, and as a result we must consider how to offer additional benefits and services to them. To provide an example, networked computers act as the enabling technology for large-scale computing, which involves a large number of computer nodes. These nodes can also be
