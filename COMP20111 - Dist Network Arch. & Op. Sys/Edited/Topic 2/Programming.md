# Programming

## Sequential Programming

- Making a [[Programs|program]] using a *sequential* language
	- Statements executed *in order* on *single* CPU
		- Hence, single [[Threads|thread]] of control

## Concurrent Programming

- Making [[Programs|program]] with *concurrent* language
	- Takes advantage of multiple [[Threads|threads]] 
		- Allows [[Concurrency#^d2d18d|parallel]]  computations/activity control

- Can run on systems with single *or* multiple CPUs
	- Single - *multitasking*
	- Multiple - *true parallelism*

- Requires support from *both* language and OS
	- Not a problem nowadays
