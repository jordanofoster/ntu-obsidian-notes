# The Dining Philosopher's Problem

5 philosophers are sat around a table, eating and thinking. Each has a plate of spaghetti, eaten with forks. The following is observed:

- Philosophers can only *eat* and *think*
- A *fork* is between each *pair of plates*
	- Each philosopher requires *two forks* to *eat*
	- No two philosophers can *share the same fork.*
