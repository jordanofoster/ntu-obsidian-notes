# Contiguous Memory Allocation

This refers to the storing of [[Processes|processes]] in [[Volatile Memory#Random Access Memory RAM|RAM]] as a *whole.* This is typically unnecessary, as only *part* of the process is actually needed. Some processes are too large to even *fit* in RAM in the first place!

The downfalls of *Contiguous Memory Allocation* are solved with [[Virtual Memory]].
