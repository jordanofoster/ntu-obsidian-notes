Higher layers have the following properties:
- Higher speeds
- Lower capacity
- Require more power
	- Generate more heat
- Expensive
- [[Volatile Memory#Volatile|Volatile]]

Lower layers have the following properties:
- Higher *capacity*
- Lower speeds
- Cheap
- [[Volatile Memory#Non-volatile|Non-volatile]]
	- Only at lowest layers
