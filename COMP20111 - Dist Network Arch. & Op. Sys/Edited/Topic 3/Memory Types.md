# Memory Types

## Volatile

Volatile memory *does not* retain information after power loss. Examples include:

- [[Memory Types#Processor Registers]]
- [[Memory Types#Cache Memory]]
- [[[Memory Types#Random Access Memory (RAM)]]]

### Processor Registers

- Small and extremely fast
- Reside within CPU
	- Typically as single containers that hold one value
- Typically referred to by name (i.e. identifying code)
