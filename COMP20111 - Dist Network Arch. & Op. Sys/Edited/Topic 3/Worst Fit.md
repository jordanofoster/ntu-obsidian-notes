# Worst Fit

![[WorstFit.png]]

- *Opposite* of [[Best Fit]]
	- Selects [[Memory Partitioning#^a0233c|hole]] that would leave *maximum amount of unused space*
		- Tries to solve [[Best Fit]]'s [[Best Fit#^c39139|'small holes']] problem
	- Theoretically, *bigger [[Memory Partitioning#^a0233c|holes]]* have *more filling possibilities*
		- Thus, *technically* not a waste of space!
			- ...Realistically, not very successful.
