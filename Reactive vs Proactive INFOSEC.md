# Reactive vs Proactive INFOSEC

- Many organisations hesitant to spend on *proactive* INFOSEC
	- Guards against *might-happens* rather than *will-happens*
		- [[Risks#^30c25f|can't completely remove risk]]
	- Hard to assess [[Risks#^3f5a60|likelihood and impact]]
		- Despite this - *reactive* INFOSEC should be deployed
			- So that attacks don't happen *again*
