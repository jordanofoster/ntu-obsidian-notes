## Classes of Distributed Systems

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
These involve decentralised point-to-point interactions across distributed entities without a centralised coordination service, and untimed control is a prominent characteristic of such systems. Examples of peer-to-peer systems include:
- Distributed file/music sharing/storage systems, including but not limited to:
	- Kademila
	- Napster
	- Gnutella
- Wireless sensor networks and online gaming systems can also fall into this category.

### Coordinated clustering
This is done across distributed resources and services, and is best understood when divided into two subclasses:

 1) The coordination of resources
 2) The coordination of services.
