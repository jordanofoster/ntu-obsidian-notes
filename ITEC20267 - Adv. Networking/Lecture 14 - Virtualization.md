# Virtualization

A virtual machine (VM), also called a guest machine, is a software simulation of a hardware platform that provides a virtual operating environment, for guest operating systems.
*platform* - or system/full virtualization VMs - run on top of hypervisors, and simulate a complete hardware platform.

Application/process VMs instead run as a language-specific software application (such as a Java VM) on top of the host OS, providing a platform-independent programming environment.

## Virtualisation Hypervisors
Hypervisors, also known as Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs), are software programs that run on actual host hardware platforms, and supervise the execution of guest OS code on the VMs.
