# GPS

## GPS Basics

There are two coordinate systems within GPS:
- Geographic coordinate systems
	- These use decimal degrees (latitude and longitude)
		- These are angles measured from the earth's centre to a point on the earth's surface.
	- And sometimes latitude as well (although this is more often than not ignored due to lack of relevance to ground routing):

	Most satellite devices operate this coordinate system.

- Map projections
	- These use the Universal Transferse Mercator (easting and northing).
