## GPS Basics

### Coordinate Systems
There are two coordinate systems within GPS; Geographic coordinate systems and Map projections.

#### Geographic

These use decimal degrees, measured from the earth's centre to a point on the earth's surface. Points are referenced by longitude and latitude in this manner, and (rarely) altitude is included.
