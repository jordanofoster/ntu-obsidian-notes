## Bluetooth Basics

Bluetooth was created by a consortium of various companies, including Ericsson, Intel, IBM, Nokia and Toshiba, amongst others. Bluetooth as a protocol aims to cover several scenarios, including:

- Connection of peripheral devices, such as loudspeakers, joysticks and headsets
- Support of ad-hoc networking using low-cost, small devices
- Bridging of networks, such as GSM (via phone) -> Bluetooth -> Laptop
