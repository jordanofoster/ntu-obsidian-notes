## Bluetooth Basics

Bluetooth was created by a consortium of various companies, including Ericsson, Intel, IBM, Nokia and Toshiba, amongst others. Bluetooth as a protocol aims to cover several scenarios, including:

- Connection of peripheral devices, such as loudspeakers, joysticks and headsets
- Support of ad-hoc networking using low-cost, small devices
- Bridging of networks, such as GSM (via phone) → Bluetooth → Laptop

Bluetooth also acts as a simple, cheap replacement of IrDA, as it is low-range, low data-rate and low power. It operates over the 2.4Ghz band worldwide, and has various design considerations to serve this purpose, including but not limited to:

- Resistance to jamming and selective frequency fading
	- Supported via FHSS over 79 channels of 1MHz each, and supporting 1600 hops/second
- Coexistence of multiple piconets, like CDMA
- Via both synchronous connections and asynchronous, connectionless methods, links are supported
- Interoperability, as the protocol stack supports TCP/IP,
