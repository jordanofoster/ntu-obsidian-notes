## The Information Concept

It is not the *actual* message, but the likelihood of a message that relates to information - the more likely a message, the lower the information. For example:

Therefore, the relationship between Information and the Probability of Information $=(probability)^-1$

Can we measure information? We need a function such that:
- It is inversely proportional to probability, $P(likelihood)$.
- If we have two information, the information, $i$, adds.

This is the case if $I = log{\frac{1}{p}}}$
