[Plenty of online resources available on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#References)

## What is the IoT?
The internet of things (IoT) refers to a network of *physical objects*, such as devices, vehicles, buildings and other items that are *embedded* with electronics, software, sensors and networking capabilities - which allows them to collect and exchange data.

Put simply, IoT refers to an ecosystem of connected physical objects that are accessible through the internet.

The concept of IoT has various other names, but they are all the same in concept:
- M2M (Machine to Machine)
- "Internet of Everything" - according to Cisco
- "World Size Web" - according to Bruce Schneier
- "Skynet" (Terminator)
- Internet of Objects

### Components of IoT networks

IoT networks themselves consist of the following components:
- Sensors
- Connectivity (Internet)
- People & Processes

### Why IoT?
It provides the following:
- Dynamic *control of industry* and *daily life*
- Improvement of *resource utilization ratio*
- Integration of *human society and physical systems*
- Flexible configuration
- Acts as a technology integrator
- Universal inter-networking

#### Corporate Aspects
- IoT is a transformational force
- Helps companies *improve performance* through *IoT analytics* and *IoT Security* to deliver better results
- *Businesses in utilities and different sectors also benefit:*7
	- Oil & gas
	- Insurance
	- Manufacturing
	- Transportation
	- Infrastructure
	- Retail
- IoT helps us make more *informed decisions*

To summarize, IoT acts as "A Gateway to the Future":
