# Mobile IP (IPv6)
## Modes of communication
There are two modes of communication between a mobile node and correspondent node in Mobile IPv6:
- Bidirectional tunneling
	- This does not require the correspondent to support Mobile IPv6
- Route Optimization
	- This requires the mobile node to register its current IP binding at the correspondent.
	- Packets from the correspondent can be routed direct to the COA of the mobile node.
