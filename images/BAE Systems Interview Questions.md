# BAE Systems Interview Questions

## Practice:

### CodeVue:

#### Square a Number:

*Max duration: 600 seconds (10 minutes)*

### Questions:

All with minimum duration of 10 seconds and a maximum of 180 (3 minutes), alongside a prep time of 1 minute.

#### "Explain why your background and experience would be a good fit for this job."

#### "Tell us what has been your best work achievement to this point in your career. What made this achievement important?"


#### "Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it."

## Actual:

### "Why have you chosen to apply for this position with BAE Systems Applied Intelligence?"

Essay with maximum character length of 1000. 1 attempt, no time limit.

### "Tell us about a time you were given a number of challenging activities to complete within a specific timeline. Please describe your approach, the steps you took, and how you made sure to finish all of the activities correctly and on time.

Video question with maximum response time of 180 seconds (3 minutes), and a minimum of 10 seconds.

Three attempts. 30 seconds to prepare before each attempt.

### "Tell us about a time you had to solve a problem at school or at work, but you were given confusing information. Please describe the situation, what you did, and the outcome."

Video question with same response lengths as prior. Same number of attempts and same amount of prep time.

### "Please describe a time you were asked to perform skills or meet requirements that were outside of your comfort zone. Describe the situation, the steps you took, and the outcome."

Video question. Ditto.

### "A snail climbs on a wall, it starts at the bottom and climbs up $n$ meters a day. Regretfully, every night it slides $m$ meters down. Given the height of the wall $H$, write a program to calculate how many days required for the snail to reach the top of the wall."

"Easy" programming challenge. Markdown enabled.

Input: *"Three non-negative integers $n$, $m$, and $H$ separated by a space. For example:*

```
3
2
11
```

Four samples are given. The following languages are permitted:

- Bash
- C
- C# 8

Output: *A single integer number, which is the number of days required for the snail to reach the top of the wall. For example:*

```
9
```
***If the snail will never be able to reach the top of the wall, print "Fail".***

Four samples are given.
