# Disposal of Information

- We should pay attention to *when* we delete information
	- Too soon and recovery is impossible post-breach
	- Too long, it is costly to store and data compliance/regulation law can be breached
- Must be *certain* that data is destroyed properly
	- Physical devices can be wiped/degaussed/shredde
