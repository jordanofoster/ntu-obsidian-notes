# Checklists and Fault Finding
## Fault Finding
There are two major methods of attempting to find faults; *scientific* - slow but sure - and *random* - if you're lucky. Somewhere between these extremes lies an *instinctive* method, based on unconscious knowledge of what symptoms link with which faults, built up by a sysadmin based on past experiences.

### The Scientific Method of Discovery
1) Examine the current situation, record it and record the fault(s) displayed.
2) Change *one* aspect of the situation and attempt to repeat the fault's circumstances.
	- Record the outcome.
