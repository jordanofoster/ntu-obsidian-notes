# Updating Systems
## Issues with Systems

Naturally, no software is perfect; they are often released too early for commercial reasons, and even mature software can need bug fixes. As a result, networks need coherent and consistent management of changes.

### Servers vs. Workstations

Servers support many users; so update procedures need to be robust. Workstations in comparison only affect individuals - so different strategies may be chosen depending on urgency, type of user, and the number of workstations.

In particular, sysadmins must ask themselves this question; do changes need to be done for *everyone*, or just a few users?

### User Notifications

This method leaves updating mostly to the user; naturally, most will get annoyed, and will never set aside the time to do so themselves (users only use computers when they *need* them to work right then and there.)

#### Types of Changes (Microsoft's Terminology)
##### Traditional Windows Systems (2k, XP, Vista, 7, 8/8.1)
- Recommended/Optional Updates
	- "*A minor revision to a software product, *"
