# Ethics & Laws
## Security in General

Three different aspects can be considered regarding the security of the network:
1) Security against legal claims/cases
2) Security against physical disaster/hardware failure
3) Security against attackers
4) Security against software failure
	- E.g. program with memory leak gradually kills system
		- Monitoring should help with this

## Ethics, Laws and Standards
For a simplistic view of the differences:
- **Ethics** - non-conformance results in bad publicity
- **Laws** - non-conformance can lead to arrest
- **Standards** - if not certified, credibility can be lost

We should care about these as Systems/Network admin because the buck could stop with us and we could be held accountable and/or prosecuted.

### Ethics
A good company will try to behave ethically to its employees, customers and suppliers. This will involve production and publication of a [Code of Conduct](https://www.usenix.org/lisa/system-administrators-code-ethics) - which goes beyond the law. Basic concepts include:
- Accountability
- Responsibility
- Liability

Examples of ethics within a company include:
- E-mail checking
- Monitoring internet use
- Blocking websites

A few questions, however:
- When is it right to read other people's e-mail?
- Why would internet use need monitoring?
- What websites should be blocked?
- What about offensive images on desktops?

### Laws/Acts that can affect IT Companies

Laws can be broken in two ways; by committing an offence, or by omission. Sys/Network admins and managers need to be aware of the following laws at minimum:
- *Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988*
- *Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002*
- *Data Protection Act 1998*
	- Including the changes made in 2018 via the GDPR
- *[Disability Discrimination Act 1995](https://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_legalcase.hcsp)*
- *[Sexual Offences Act 2003](http://www.computing.co.uk/itweek/news/2085638/rules-cut-porn-risks)*
- *Investigatory Powers Act 2016*
- *Telecommunications* - (Lawful Business Practice) (Interception of Communications) Regulations 2000 (LBP Regulations)
- *Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998*

- *[Part 11 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/ukpga_20010024_en_11)*
- *Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015* (Communications Identity)#

#### Copyright Act
Software is considered as a piece of literary work. FAST applies Copyright Law against companies, and companies blame IT/System administrators. How can we keep a check on copyright within the company?
- Keep good control on licenses; where possible, use site licences or licence servers.
- Ensure no pirated software is added by users.
- Ensure copying of documentation/printing of information from the internet follows the CLA(?).

#### E-Commerce Requirements
Sources: http://www.out-law.com/page-431 and the OFT publication *"A guide for businesses on distance selling"*

Both those responsible for a website, as well as service providers - whether involved in e-commerce or not - should provide the following minimum information, which should be easily, directly and permanently accessible:
- The *name* of the service provider must be given somewhere easily accessible on the site.
- The *email address* of the service provider must be given. It is not sufficient to include a 'contact us' form without also providing an email address.
