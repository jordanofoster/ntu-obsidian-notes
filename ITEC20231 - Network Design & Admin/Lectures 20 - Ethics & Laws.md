# Ethics & Laws
## Security in General

Three different aspects can be considered regarding the security of the network:
1) Security against legal claims/cases
2) Security against physical disaster/hardware failure
3) Security against attackers
4) Security against software failure
	- E.g. program with memory leak gradually kills system
		- Monitoring should help with this

## Ethics, Laws and Standards
For a simplistic view of the differences:
- **Ethics** - non-conformance results in bad publicity
- **Laws** - non-conformance can lead to arrest
- **Standards** - if not certified, credibility can be lost

We should care about these as Systems/Network admin because the buck could stop with us and we could be held accountable and/or prosecuted.
