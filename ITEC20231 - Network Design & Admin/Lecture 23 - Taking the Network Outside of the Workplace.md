# Taking the Network Outside of the Workplace
Networks are moved outside of the workplace under the following circumstances:
- Laptops are used outside of the office
- Web access to your services
- Data storage devices/media are taken outside of the office
- Printed material is taken home.
- (Special case) access to a wireless network from outside of the building.

## What are the Issues?
Mainly, Security - particularly because in such circumstances, users believe that they are doing nothing wrong; indeed, in some cases, taking the network "outside" may be necessary for their job.

## An Important Reminder
*All* security can be breached, given enough time and money, and this is represented by how devices are advertised:
- *Encrypting PIN Pad Devices* specify attack resistance in terms of cost and time required.
- Safes use a *UL* (Underwriters' Laboratories) rating system (e.g., TL-15, TRTL-30, etc.)

On many occasions, security conflicts with ease, convenience and productivity; technical security measures must be supported by physical and "intellectual" security (resistance against social engineering).

## Use of a work laptop outside
- Files can be held in the following manners:
	- On a local drive
	- On a server, available offline via caching.
- Email (accessed via web browser)
- Other potential data vectors.

### Files held on a Local Drive
These are vulnerable if the laptop dies anyway, so the user must be educated about backups. We must also consider what happens if the laptop gets stolen:
- We ensure the non-domain account also has a decent password/other protection (by, again, educating the user)
- Encryption must also be considered:
	- Are the files worth protecting?
	- If so, which files?
- Some files may only be worth *recovering*
	- This means they would cost time/money to restore, but do not contain sensitive information in and of themselves.
