# Taking the Network Outside of the Workplace

- Laptops are used outside of the office

- Data storage devices/media are taken outside of the office

*All* security can be breached, given enough time and money, and this is represented by how devices are advertised:
- *Encrypting PIN Pad Devices* specify attack resistance in terms of cost and time required.
- Safes use a *UL* (Underwriters' Laboratories) rating system (e.g., TL-15, TRTL-30, etc.)

On many occasions, security conflicts with ease, convenience and productivity; technical security measures must be supported by physical and "intellectual" security (resistance against social engineering).

	- On a local drive

- Email (accessed via web browser)
- Other potential data vectors.
