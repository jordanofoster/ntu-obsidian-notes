## What aspects affect the user most?

User requirements and expectations differ from those of the administrator; their concerns tend to be around accessibility, including:

- Availability of disk space, both local and shared
- Printing
- Logging in/Access to resources
- Using applications
- E-mail
- Overall speed of task completion

### Disk Space

User machines may have comparatively large disks. This tends to be unlikely in a *hot-desking* situation, and it brings about the temptation for users to store their files locally, causing problems.

As a result, it is better to use servers for storing user files; there is better control of backup/restore procedures, and disk quotas can be applied.

#### Windows Disk Quotas

![[DiskQuotaProperties.png]]

There are three stages to implementation of disk quotas on WIndows machines:

1) Enabling disk quotas on a volume.
2) Configuring quota defaults
3) Creating quota entries.

![[DiskQuotaProperties2.png]]
**Step 1:**

1) Select NTFS volume for quota application using Explorer and open Properties dialog.
	- Alternatively, use disk management snap-in to MMC.

**Step 2: Enable Management**

2) Enable management; this has to be done volume-by-volume.
	- Note that in this case, the system has been set to deny users disk space when the Quota is exceeded.

**Step 3: Configuring**

1) You must select an appropriate default size.
 	- You can also set a size that generates a warning to the user, and configure the system to log these events.

##### Creating Quota Entries

These are exceptions to the default rule that allow users to be given more or less than the default quota. New entries can be created, or existing ones can be modified by double-clicking the entry. When doing so, make sure to select appropriate units.

New quota entries can be generated by selecting a number of users at once; but quotas themselves are applied individually.

![[QuotaEntriesWindow.png]]

This window shows all disk quota entries. To add a new one, the *new quota entry* option must be selected, and details must be applied for the user.

Quotas can also be assigned via Group Policy. This has the advantage of allowing settings to be applied automatically on volumes, therefore meaning they do not have to be setup independently for each of them.

#### Linux Disk Quotas

Quotas can be enabled by adding fields into the `/etc/fstab` file to allow `/usr/grp` quotas, such as the following:

`/dev/hda2 /home ext3 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 1 1`

After this, the volume must be remounted using `umount` and `mount`, but alternatively a reboot also works. Regardless, `quotacheck -avug` should be ran afterwards to setup quota files and check the volume for current usage, and should be re-run regularly to keep stats accurate.

Quotas for users and groups can be assigned using `edquota`, and `repquota` can be used to generate reports on current quota usage.

#### Impact of Disk Quotas on Users and Administrators

Users can find quotas frustrating if the sizes are set too low for typical usage. As a result, best practice is to investigate how users function before setting one.

Users can also be given a warning when approaching a full quota, and as such need education in how to act in response.

Administrators may get too many user complaints if the quota is too low, but on the other hand, quotas need to be set - else space may run out arbitrarily.

Summarised, managing and monitoring processes is a time-consuming process (will be covered in a later session).

### File Server Resource Manager

![[FSRMDiag.png]]

This provides finer grain control of quotas, and more means to warn users - but it is not covered in this lecture.

### Printing and the user

As before, the assumption is made that each user does not have their own printer. As such, the need for users to access printing must be balanced with the costs of paper, ink and printers.

Printer properties define default behaviour for all users of a printer. For high throughput, printer spooling may additionally be used, and for more control - multiple logical printers for a single physical printer.

#### Shared Printers

![[SharedPrinterProperties.png]]

It should be noted that after the printer has been installed on the print server, it must be shared, and then clients must be connected. The printer properties window has a tab for sharing; additional drivers must be specified if clients are running an older OS.

##### Other Useful Information in Properties

![[PrinterLocationProperty.png]]
![[PrinterCapabilityProperty.png]]

The printer location can be specified, and users can check printer capabilities; Paper of different sizes can also be assigned to specific trays.

#### Client Access to Printers

This made available via various methods:
- The *Add Printer Wizard,* where Search can be specified
- Browsing via Windows Explorer
- Searching Active Directory

Searching can be done with a range of criteria:
- Location
- Double-sided capable
- Stapling, etc.

This is key to efficiency in a business - however, users need to know that they can do this, by being trained on procedures.

It must also be ensured (*via printer permissions*) that users cannot change the default behaviour of a printer (though they may be permitted to set behaviour for a specific print job

##### Client Access to Printers using scripting.

A *logon* and *logoff* script can be used:

**Logon script:**
```
sub loadprinters()
	set network = createobject("wscript.network")
	network.AddWindowsPrinterConnection(\\prntsrvr\clrlaser)
	network.AddWindowsPrinterConnection(\\prntsrvr\bwlaser)
end sub
```
**Logoff script:**
```
sub unloadprinters()
	set network = createobject("wscript.network")
	network.RemovePrinterConnection("\\prntsrvr\clrlaser", true, true)
	network.RemovePrinterConnection("\\prntsrvr\bwlaser", true, true)
end sub
```

These scripts would be associated to the user account; put on a shared drive to allow access to all. As soon as the user logs in or out, the script is executed, as shown above in VB script.

#### Printer Pooling

![[PrinterPoolingWindow.png]]

Here, multiple physical printers are used as a single logical printer, so the job appears on whichever printer is available. All printers must be able to use the same driver, as there is only 1 logical printer; they should also be physically close together, since the user will not know which one to print to.

##### Multiple Logical to Single Physical Printer

This is used to allow different conditions to be set for different user groups, to a single physical printer. Different priorities (1-99, highest-lowest) can be set for the logical printers, alongside different access times and defaults (e.g. trays/paper, double-sided).

It must be ensured the different logical printers have appropriate ACL settings (e.g. to allow *Executives* access to all, but *Clerks* access to only a few logical printers).

###### Advanced Printer Properties

![[AdvPrinterProperties.png]]

#### User Profiles

These allow users to have a customised environment independent of other users. It contains the following:
- User-stored documents/files
- Application configs/settings
- Desktop/environment settings
- Control Panel settings/configs

Profiles can be Local, Roaming or Mandatory.
