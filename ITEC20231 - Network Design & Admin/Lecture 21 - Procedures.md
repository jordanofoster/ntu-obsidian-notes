# Procedures
## Managing the Network
*Coping* is where administrators deal with individual situations from scratch, before they arise (even if they've happened before). *Managing* is where organizational needs have been analysed and procedures defined and used for the range of occurring activities - and at its best, has procedures in place to check and update procedures.

## Golden Rules of network administration
- If it isn't broken, don't mess with it
- When in doubt, reboot!
- Never ever change anything *late in the day.*
- Never ever change anything *on Friday.*
- Always be able to *undo* what you are about to do.
- If you don't understand it, don't mess with it on a production system; Use test systems for experimenting.
- Dedicate a system disk devoted only to the system software. Put applications on other drives.
- Projects are not done until tested by yourself and by end-users.
- Projects are not done until documented.
- All projects take twice as long as planned.
- Use default settings when possible.
- Do not roll out new software without training end users:
	- Roll out an employee's new application immediately after they have received training to reinforce what has been learned.
- If you're having to fight fires all the time, *find the source.*
