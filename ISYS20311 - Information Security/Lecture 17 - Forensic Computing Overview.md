# Forensic Computing Overview

## Key Concepts
- Digital investigations are conducted for a number of reasons:
	- Securing computer systems
	- Criminality/legal compliance
	- Information management
- IT facilitates both the commission and investigation of the events in question.
	- Technology enables new types of crime, and the means to investigate those crimes.
- Digital investigations should be carried out in a way that allows any resulting evidence to be presented in court.
	- There can be a conflict between doing it right and doing it fast.
	- The primary solution to this is to carry out investigations on non-persistent forensic images, rather than the original computer.
- Evidence should be presented in a legally valid and compelling manner.
