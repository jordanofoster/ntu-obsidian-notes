# Forensic Computing Overview

## Key Concepts
- Digital investigations are conducted for a number of reasons:
	- Securing computer systems
	- Criminality/legal compliance
	- Information management
- IT facilitates both the commission and investigation of the events in question.
	- Technology enables new types of crime, and the means to investigate those crimes.
- Digital investigations should be carried out in a way that allows any resulting evidence to be presented in court.
	- There can be a conflict between doing it right and doing it fast.
	- The primary solution to this is to carry out investigations on non-persistent forensic images, rather than the original computer.
- Evidence should be presented in a legally valid and compelling manner.

## What is Computer Forensics?

*"\[Computer Forensics is\] the application of computer investigation and analysis techniques to determine potential evidence."* - Li & Seberry (2003).

The field focuses on investigation and analysis of systems to determine the responsibility for an event (or set of events). Forensic specialists follow clear, well-defined methodologies and procedures, but have to be flexible when faced with the unusual or unexpected. Activities they perform with data include:

- Identification
- Extraction
- Preservation
- Interpretation
- Analysis
- Documentation

### Where and What?

Computer forensics is used both by law enforcement and organisations. The concerns for each are different:

#### Common concerns for law enforcement
- Unauthorised access to computer resources
- Monitoring/capture of network traffic to steal user IDs, passwords and other sensitive information.
- Use of digital equipment for criminal activities (encrypted emails, crime-related documents, etc).
- Computer/network activity
