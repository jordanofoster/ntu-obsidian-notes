# Dealing with Management and Office Politics

## Are office politics an issue for InfoSec professionals?

A survey from 2005 states that a quarter of the InfoSec workforce spends most of their day dealing with internal politics or selling security to upper management. This is because office politics is often an unavoidable fact of life, and because security costs money without providing any obvious return on investment; because no news is good news when it comes to good security.

## Types of organisations

Different types of organisations have different office politics. There are four types of organisational culture:
- Power
- Task
- Person
- Role

### Power

The power culture is illustrated as a spider's web '...because the key to the while organisation sits in the centre, surrounded by ever-widening circles of intimates and influence. The closer you are to the spider, the more influence you have.'

Organisations with poewr culture can respond quickly to events, but their success is heavily dependent on the abilities of those at the centre. Size is a problem.

Power culture environments attrack people who are *power-orientated* and politically minded; they take risks and do not rate security highly. Control of resources is the main power base in this culture, with some elements of personal power in the centre.

Performance in such environements is based on results, and such organisations are tolerant of means. Such organisations require that employees correctly anticipate what those in power expect of them and perform accordingly.

### Role

The role culture has strong functional or specialised areas, coordinated by a narrow band of senior management at the top. There is a high degree of formalisation and standardisation, and work is controlled by rules and procedures that define the job.

Position is the main power source in role cultures; personal power is frowned upon and expert power is rarely tolerated - rules and procedures are the chief methods of influence.

This type of organisation succeeds most in steady, predictable or controllable markets, where economies of scale are more important that flexibility or where technical expertise and depth of specialisation are more important than innovation or reduction of cost (for example in many public service organisations).

For employees, the environment offers security and the opoortunity to acquire specialist expertise. However the culture is frustrating for the ambitious and power oriented that want control over their work, or are more interested in results rather than method. Such persons will only be content as senior managers.

### Task

Task culture is job/project oriented. It is a team-based, where group work takes precedence over individual objectives and most status/style differences. Work structures in this environment are often matrix/project-based. Influence is centralised on expert power rather than position or personal power.

This environment provides a lot of autonomy to individuals, as judgement is based on results, and there are easy working relationships within groups and mutual respect based on ability (instead of age/status).

Task-cultured organisations can respond rapidly, since each group contains all decision-making powers required. Task culture is therefore appropriate when flexibility/sensitivity to the market/environment is important; such as where the marekt is competitive, a product's lifecycle is short or reaction speed is critical.

Control in this enivronment is difficult. Senior managers concentrate on allocation projects, people and resources. Task cultures can become role or power-based if resources are limited or the organisation is unsuccessful.

### Person

Person culture is unusual. If there is structure in an organisation, it only exists to serve and assist individuals, to further their own interests without an overriding objective. As a result, control mechanisms and hierarchy is impossible here except by mutual consent. Individuals can leave the organisation, but can rarely be evicted. Influence is shared and power is mostly expert-based. That is, people do what they are good at and are listened to for their expertise. Some resource power also exists.

Consultants (employed or freelance) and architects' partnerships often have such culture, as do some universities. Many specialists have personal preferences for this environment, but find themselves operating in orthodox cultures instead. Such people are not easily manageable.

## How does power affect organisation politics

- Positional power:
	- "I am your boss"
		- "Do what I say"
		- "If you do this, I can promote/reward you"
		- "If I don't want you to do something I will deny the information needed to do so."
	- Resource power
		- "Yes you can, or No you can't have an extra/specific person on the team"
		- "Refusal to release information (e.g. pentesters refusing to reveal their methods)"
		- "You can/can't buy this software/travel here"
	- Personal power
		- "I am the expert on this subject"
		- 'I've always treated you nicely, will you do the same?'
		- "I am a (possibly minor) celebrity - do what I do"

## How do you respond to organisational politics?

Common reactions are:
- Avoid it if possible
- Complain to the boss of a person making your life difficult.
- Complain generally to co-workers
- Leave

Better reactions are:
- Focus on what is best for the org
- Make friends
- Play nice
- Fight fair
- Keep your cool
- Forgive/forget
- Don't have favourites
- Don't gossip

### Specific tactics for difficult situations

#### Conflicts
- Defuse them if possible
- It's better in the long run to fix the problem with the least embarassment, than make an example of someone.

#### Difficult people
- If you must meet them, make an appointment shortly before one or both of you need to be elsewhere (to limit the length of the meeting)
- For the emotionally difficult, meet them where another is present, or leave the meeting/office door open.
	- For a boss, you may have to formally request that another is present, such has a union representative. Many organisations have policies permitting this. 

### Lazy/Unproductive people.
- Have regular progress meetings, ask for (brief) summaries of work completed
- If they still continue, go to their boss using summaries as evidence.

### Losing your temper
Don't; as a rule of thumb, the first to get angry is the first to lose the argument.7

## Meetings
They can affect office politics in various ways:

- Positive
	- Project progress meetings where some work is dependant on other's output.
	- Meetings where grievances are aired/minuted and actions assigned.
- Negative
	- Meetings where the manager does most of the talking:
		- Why not just send an email?
	- Hijacked meetings
		- Can happen when a widespread greivance isn't dealt with
			- Certain people will also have favoured greivances
		- Meetings that discuss issues that cannot be changed under current system/culture
			- Such changes require detailed plans and top management approval
		- Meeting regarding the format/frequency/usefulness of meetings
