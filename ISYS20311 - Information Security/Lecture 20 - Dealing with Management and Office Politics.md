# Dealing with Management and Office Politics

## Are office politics an issue for InfoSec professionals?

A survey from 2005 states that a quarter of the InfoSec workforce spends most of their day dealing with internal politics or selling security to upper management. This is because office politics is often an unavoidable fact of life, and because security costs money without providing any obvious return on investment; because no news is good news when it comes to good security.

## Types of organisations

Different types of organisations have different office politics. There are four types of organisational culture:
- Power
- Task
- Person
- Role

### Power

The power culture is illustrated as a spider's web '...because the key to the while organisation sits in the centre, surrounded by ever-widening circles of intimates and influence. The closer you are to the spider, the more influence you have.'

Organisations with poewr culture can respond quickly to events, but their success is heavily dependent on the abilities of those at the centre. Size is a problem.

Power culture environments attrack people who are *power-orientated* and politically minded; they take risks and do not rate security highly. Control of resources is the main power base in this culture, with some elements of personal power in the centre.

Performance in such environements is based on results, and such organisations are tolerant of means. Such organisations require that employees correctly anticipate what those in power expect of them and perform accordingly.

### Role

The role culture has strong functional or specialised areas, coordinated by a narrow band of senior management at the top. There is a high degree of formalisation and standardisation, and work is controlled by rules and procedures that define the job.

Position is the main power source in role cultures; personal power is frowned upon and expert power is rarely tolerated - rules and procedures are the chief methods of influence.

This type of organisation succeeds most in steady, predictable or controllable markets, where economies of scale are more important that flexibility or where technical expertise and depth of specialisation are more important than innovation or reduction of cost (for example in many public service organisations).

For employees, the environment offers security and the opoortunity to acquire specialist expertise. However the culture is frustrating for the ambitious and power oriented that want control over their work, or are more interested in results rather than method. Such persons will only be content as senior managers.

### Task

Task culture is job/project oriented. It is a team-based, where group work takes precedence over individual objectives and most status/style differences. Work structures in this environment are often matrix/project-based. Influence is centralised on expert power rather than position or personal power.

This environment provides a lot of autonomy to individuals, as judgement is based on results
