# Legal Proceedings

## Requirements for electronic evidence

- Evidence must be obtained using legal methods.
- Evidence must follow certain rules:
	- Is it relevant and neccessary?
	- As stated before, has it been acquired legally?
	- Does it comply with procedural requirements, and thus is procedurally admissible?
- Electronic evidence should be evaluated:
	- It can be challenged by an opposing party on the following grounds:
		- For example, the authenticity of an email conversation
		- Or just generally, the ingerity and accuracy of the evidence.

## Admissible Evidence

Evidence must follow a chain of custody; for example, records of everyone who has touched or could have otherwise modified data on that machine after the incident, until the forensic image has been taken.

The easiest way is to stop anyone from touching it.

Regarding forensic images themselves; they are typically accepted in court if hash values have been verified - but some jurisdictions and police forces may want the original computer untouched in case the court asks for another verification.

If evidence is on social media or private email, sometimes ISPs can be forced to release information with a court order.

## Criminal or Civil

If it is possible to identify the perpetrator of an information security breach, the breach itself may fall under criminal or civil law, so the victim may have a choice on which charges to press. If criminal charges are pressed, the police becomes involved, and jail sentences are able to be given; however the courts will only deal criminal charges if the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

If civil charges are pressed, solicitors are involved - fines for damages are available, and a balance of probabilities is required.

### Criminal Law

#### Theft

The key damage in many breaches is the unauthorised obtaining of information. The main question is whether this is theft; the legal definition is as follows:

*\[theft is] appropriating property belonging to another dishonestly with intent to permanently deprive.* 

This shows that information theft is *explicitly* excluded from the Theft Act 1968, and court cases have upheld this interpretation of the law (see *Oxford v. Moss, 1979*).

#### Fraud Act 2006

This updated various offences originally prosecuted under the Theft Acts. Under this act, it is an offence to do the following with intent of making gain for yourself or loss for another:
- Make a false representation
- Fail to disclose information that you are legally required to disclose
- Abuse a position of safeguarding financial interests

The act also makes it an offence to possess or make articles for use in frauds.

#### Computer Misuse Act 1990

This Act was originally design to deter hackers. Unauthorised access to a computer is defined as a summary offence, with a max sentence of 6 months. The unauthorised *modification* of a computer can be an offence of either kind, but contains a larger max sentence of 2 years.

An extension of this, the Serious Crime Act of 2015, gives a maximum sentence of 14 years for causing damage to an economy or environment. [See this telegraph article.](https://telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/09/hacker-sets-every-emergency-siren-dallas/?)

Denial of service is also covered by case law under this Act (See *DPP v. Lennon, 2006*).

Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in computer misuse offences is also a crime under Section 37 of the *Police and Justice Act*
