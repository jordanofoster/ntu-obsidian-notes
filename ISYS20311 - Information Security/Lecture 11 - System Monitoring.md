# System Monitoring

## What is system monitoring?

System monitoring software analyses the operation and performance of the system. It can also intervene in operation and performance. System monitoring is used in a few situations:

**No intervention**
- Only system logs are taken.

**Alerts**
- The system detects and alerts about possible errors and/or unusual behaviour.

**Emergency Management**
- Shuts down the system if extreme levels are reached

**Everyday Management**
- Automatically changes system parameters to optimise performance.

### Why monitor systems?

System monitoring improves the use of hardware; by detecting poorly functioning machines, they are fixed faster. Incidents themselves are also detected faster, and sometimes prevented.

The faster resolution of problems improves customer service and organizational reputation, as less human hours are required to manage systems.
