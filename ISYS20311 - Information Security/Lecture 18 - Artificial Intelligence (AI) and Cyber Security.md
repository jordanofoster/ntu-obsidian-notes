# Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber Security

Cyber security is the main focus of companies in recent years. Providing security is a monotonous and repetitive job, however; we can use the power of machine learning and other data mining techniques to streamline the process.

## Cyber Security

Elements of Cyber Security include:
- Application Security
- Information Security
- Network Security
- Disaster Recovery / business continuity
- Operational Security
- End-user education

Types of Cyber Security Threats include:
- Ransomware
- Malware
- Social Engineering
- Phishing

## Branches of Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
	- These give computers the potential to learn without explicit programming.
- Neural Networks
	- These are a set of algorithms that make use of neurology to imitate the human brain's operating process.
- Robotics
	- This is a field of science that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, etc., to deploy robots for laborious tasks.
- Expert Systems
	- These are computer systems that mimic the decision-making intelligence of a human expert.
- Fuzzy Logic
	- These are techniques that represent and modify uncertain information by measuring the degree to which a hypothesis is correct.
- Natural Language Processing
	- This helps in communications between computers and humans, through the use of natural language.

### Machine Learning

Computer programs are said to learn from experience $(E)$ with respect to some class of tasks $(T)$, and performance measure $(P)$ - if the performance at $T$ (if measured by $P$) improves with $E$.

Machine learning algorithms generate models from data; there are two types - supervised and unsupervised. Algorithms themselves tend to perform classification and clustering with the assistance of probability, statistics and other fields of mathematics.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Classification

Classification algorithms include:
- SVM
- Na√Øve Bayesian Filtering
- Decision Trees
- Random forests
- Logistic regression

Additionally, esembles of 3 algorithms can be present (with voting).

#### Clustering
Clustering algorithms include:
- K-Means
- Farthest first

##### Limitation of Clustering
Clustering is subjective:

#### Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms
![[Pasted image 20220221154048.png]]

This is done through three equations, where:
$tp =$ *true positive*
$fp =$ *false positive*
$fn =$ *false negative*
$$Precision = \frac{tp}{tp+fp}$$
$$Recall = \frac{tp}{tp+fn}$$
$$F1 = \frac{2\times(Precision\times Recall)}{(Precision + Recall)}$$
#### Supervised Machine Learning

An example of supervised learning involves the use of decision trees to distinguish between spam and non-spam email based on the frequency of terms/words, used in a large historical set of phishing and non-phishing emails.

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning

An example of this would include using self-organizing maps and clustering techniques to identify anomalous IP traffic.

#### Reinforcement Learning

This is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions in a game-like situation, such as bringing threat intelligence and the end user into the loop.

### Benefits of Machine Learning in Cyber Security
Machine learning can be useful in the following Cyber Security contexts:
- Handling large volumes of data
- Security task automation, such as:
	- Malware analysis
	- Network log analysis
	- Vulnerability assessments
	- Raising alarms, etc.
- Threat detection and classification
- Network risk scoring
	- This is the use of quantitative measures to assign risk scores to sections of networks, and helps organisations to prioritise resources.

#### Application of machine learning in Cyber Security
##### Machine learning for network protection

This can be used for both Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and for network traffic analysis. Examples include:

- Regression, to predict the network packet parameters and compare them with the normal ones
- Classification to identify different classes of network attacks such as scanning and spoofing
- Clustering for forensic analysis

##### Machine learning for application security

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can have some help from machine learning, but a universal model cannot be developed to deal with all threats; some examples are listed below, however:

- Regression to detect anomalies in HTTP requests, such as auth bypass.
- Classification to detect known types of attacks, such as injections (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
- Clustering of user activity, to detect DDOS attacks and mass exploitation.

##### Machine learning for user behaviour

Unlike malware detection (which focuses on common attacks), user behaviour is a complex layer and an unsupervised learning problem, which cannot be easily solved through training of a classifier. Examples include:

- Regression to detect anomalies in user actions (such as logins at an unusual time)
- Classification to group different users (for peer-group analysis)

## Cyber Security Tasks
1) Prediction
2) Prevention
3) Detection
4) Response
5) Monitoring

## Case Study - Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

### Background

An intrusion can be identified as any set of actions that attempt to compromise the CIA triad of a resource. There are three classes of intruder:
- The masquerader, an illegitimate user that penetrates the system using a legitimate user's account
- The misfeasor, a legitimate user that misuses his/her privileges by accessing un
