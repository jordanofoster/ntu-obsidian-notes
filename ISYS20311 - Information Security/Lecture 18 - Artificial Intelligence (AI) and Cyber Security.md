# Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber Security

Cyber security is the main focus of companies in recent years. Providing security is a monotonous and repetitive job, however; we can use the power of machine learning and other data mining techniques to streamline the process.

## Cyber Security

Elements of Cyber Security include:
- Application Security
- Information Security
- Network Security
- Disaster Recovery / business continuity
- Operational Security
- End-user education

Types of Cyber Security Threats include:
- Ransomware
- Malware
- Social Engineering
- Phishing

## Branches of Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
	- These give computers the potential to learn without explicit programming.
- Neural Networks
	- These are a set of algorithms that make use of neurology to imitate the human brain's operating process.
- Robotics
	- This is a field of science that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, etc., to deploy robots for laborious tasks.
- Expert Systems
	- These are computer systems that mimic the decision-making intelligence of a human expert.
- Fuzzy Logic
	- These are techniques that represent and modify uncertain information by measuring the degree to which a hypothesis is correct.
- Natural Language Processing
	- This helps in communications between computers and humans, through the use of natural language.

### Machine Learning

Computer programs are said to learn from experience $(E)$ with respect to some class of tasks $(T)$, and performance measure $(P)$ - if the performance at $T$ (if measured by $P$) improves with $E$.

Machine learning algorithms generate models from data; there are two types - supervised and unsupervised. Algorithms themselves tend to perform classification and clustering with the assistance of probability, statistics and other fields of mathematics.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Classification

Classification algorithms include:
- SVM
- Na√Øve Bayesian Filtering
- Decision Trees
- Random forests
- Logistic regression

Additionally, esembles of 3 algorithms can be present (with voting).

#### Clustering
Clustering algorithms include:
- K-Means
- Farthest first

##### Limitation of 

#### Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms

This is done through three equations, where:
$tp =$ *true positive*
$fp =$ *false positive*
$fn =$ *false negative*
$$Precision = \frac{tp}{tp+fp}$$
$$Recall = \frac{tp}{tp+fn}$$
$$F1 = \frac{2\times(Precision\times Recall)}{(Precision + Recall)}$$
#### Supervised Machine Learning

An example of supervised learning involves the use of decision trees to distinguish between spam and non-spam email based on the frequency of terms/words, used in a large historical set of phishing and non-phishing emails.

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning

An example of this would include using self-organizing maps and clustering techniques to identify anomalous IP traffic.
