# Business Continuity

*'A holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organisation and provides a framework for building resilience with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand and value-creating activities.'* (Business Continuity Institute, 2001).

## Why does it matter?

Without business continuity, the following can happen:
- Loss of work to competitors
- Failures within the supply chain
- Loss of reputation
- Human Resources issues
- Health and Safety liabilities
- Higher insurance premiums

40% of businesses affected by the Manchester bombing went out of business permanently, as they did not have business continuity.

## How is it done?

In short; make policies and ensure that they are followed. An ISO standard exists for organizations to reach business continuity with, and be certified for.

### ISO/IEC 27031

This refers to *Security Techniques - Guidelines for information and communication technology readiness for business continuity.* In other words, this is the familiar Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, as shown below:

#### Additional rules for emergency services, local authorities and utility companies

The *Civil Contingencies Act 2004* exists to enforce this. Part 1 of the Act places a legal obligation upon emergency services and local authorities (defined as *"Category 1 responders"* under the act) to plan, exercise for and assess the risk of emergencies, as well as undertaking Business Continuity Management.

Category 1 responders are also responsible for warning and informing the public in relation to emergencies, and local authorities are required to provide business continuity advice to local businesses.

It also places legal obligations for increased cooperation and information sharing between different emergency services and also to non-emergency services that may have a role in emergency situations (such as electric companies). Such non-emergency services are defined as *Category 2 responders* under the Act.

Each responder has an emergency planning officer, sometimes called a civil protection, civil contingencies or resilience officer (or also alternatively, simply 'risk manager') who is usually responsible for ensuring their organisation is in compliance with the Act and sharing information with other responders. The usual way of checking compliance is by regularly testing plans by reviews or exercises.
