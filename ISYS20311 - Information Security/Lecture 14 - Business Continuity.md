# Business Continuity

*'A holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organisation and provides a framework for building resilience with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand and value-creating activities.'* (Business Continuity Institute, 2001).

## Why does it matter?

Without business continuity, the following can happen:
- Loss of work to competitors
- Failures within the supply chain
- Loss of reputation
- Human Resources issues
- Health and Safety liabilities
- Higher insurance premiums

40% of businesses affected by the Manchester bombing went out of business permanently, as they did not have business continuity.

## How is it done?

In short; make policies and ensure that they are followed. An ISO standard exists for organizations to reach business continuity with, and be certified for.

### ISO/IEC 27031

This refers to *Security Techniques - Guidelines for information and communication technology readiness for business continuity.* In other words, this is the familiar Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, as shown below:

#### Additional rules for emergency services, local authorities and utility companies

The *Civil Contingencies Act 2004* exists to enforce this. Part 1 of the Act places a legal obligation upon emergency services and local authorities (defined as *"Category 1 responders"* under the act) to plan, exercise for and assess the risk of emergencies, as well as undertaking Business Continuity Management.
