# Incident Prevention

In past lectures, we have learned how to write policies to (hopefully) prevent indcidents. Unfortunately, people do not always follow policy, and incidents *do* still happen.

There are three ways to help policies to work:
- [[Lecture 13 - Incident Prevention#Check that staff know the policies|Check that staff know the policies]]
- [[Lecture 13 - Incident Prevention#Check that staff follow the policies|Check that staff follow the policies]]
- [[Lecture 13 - Incident Prevention#Real-Life Scenarios|Real-Life Scenarios]]

In the inevitable outcome that policies eventually *don't* work:

- [[Lecture 13 - Incident Prevention#Stick and Carrot|Stick and Carrot]]

## Check that staff know the policies

There are several methods:

- Spot checks - visit someone at their desk and give them a policy quiz

- Host a lunchtime quiz on the policies, with prizes

- Put up big posters to remind people of policies, in order to keep the profile of the policies high

## Check that staff follow the policies

With the spot checks:
- Do staff have confidential information on their desk?
- Has their screen been left unlocked? etc.

Self-phishing:
- Some companies send their own staff phishing emails, then analyse how many give away requested confidential information
- There are [free self-phishing tools](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/top-9-free-phishing-simulators/#gref), and free managed campaigns (usually by a vendor of a commercial tool)

Alternatively, manufacture an obvious breach of policy and observe how many staff report and/or attempt to fix it.

## Real-Life Scenarios

These are done by penetration testers and white hat hackers.

## Training options

- Online courses with additional test
- Lectures/seminars
- Q&A sessions with experts
- Mini-apprenticeships
- Simulations, such as the aforementioned self-phishing

## Stick and Carrot
This is part of a performance review, which can act as both the *stick* and the *carrot.*
