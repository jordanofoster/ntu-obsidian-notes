# GDPR: The General Data Protection Regulation

## Legal Requirements

In many countries, failure to protect customers' personal data adequately is against the law. This typically results in a fine for the organisation, but other penalties are possible.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is an example of one such law. Because it is an EU directive, it actually generates a set of laws; every EU country is required to pass a law themselves to implement it. GDPR is recent and other new laws may copy it, and it claims to apply to anyone who does business in an EU country

## The General Data Protection Regulation

GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive of 1995, and was enforced in member states of the EU from 25th May 2018. It creates a (fairly) level playing field across the EU.

### Changes Since 1995

- Jury opinion on data protection has changed over time due to case law, particularly regarding Campbell v MGN in 2002. 
- The average UK business now uses 24 systems to manage and store personal data; with one in five using 40. Meanwhile, almost half share personal data from customers with other businesses.
- On a daily basis, large enterprises collect data from 577 individuals, with 25% collecting data from more than 1000 people every day.
- Despite the fact that almost two-thirds storee and manage personal data based on predictive analytics, they could not agree who owns the data. A quarter think the customer is the owner, while half think it is the company.

Regarding technological advancements, we now have cloud storage, backup servers and recovery tech - and societally an increased focus on privacy.

### Who has to comply?

- Data controller/processors established in one or more EU Member State
- Data controller/processors established outside the EU, and:
	- Offering goods/services to individuals in the EU
	- Monitoring behaviour of individuals taking place in the EU
- Enforcement of GDPR outside the EU can be difficult, but preventing further business in the EU is *not* - so this will still apply to many or all UK businesses in the UK after Brexit.
