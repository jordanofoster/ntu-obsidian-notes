# GDPR: The General Data Protection Regulation

## Legal Requirements

In many countries, failure to protect customers' personal data adequately is against the law. This typically results in a fine for the organisation, but other penalties are possible.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is an example of one such law. Because it is an EU directive, it actually generates a set of laws; every EU country is required to pass a law themselves to implement it. GDPR is recent and other new laws may copy it, and it claims to apply to anyone who does business in an EU country

## The General Data Protection Regulation

GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive of 1995, and was enforced in member states of the EU from 25th May 2018. It creates a (fairly) level playing field across the EU.

### Changes Since 1995

- Jury opinion on data protection has changed over time due to case law, particularly in regards to Campbell v MGN in 2002.
