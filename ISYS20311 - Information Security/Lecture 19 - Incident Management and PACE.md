# Incident Management and PACE

## Security incident management

This refers to the process of identifying, managing, recording and analysing security threats or incidents in real time. Examples include:
- An attempted intrusion
- Successful compromise/data breach
- Policy violation

### Standard approaches

The [ISO/IEC Standard 27045](http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27035.html) outlines a five-step process, including:
1) Prepare for handling incidents.
2) Identify potential incidents through monitoring, and report all of them.
3) Assess identified incidents to determine appropriate next steps for risk mitigation.
4) Respond to the incident by containing, investigating and resolving it (based on step 3).
5) Learn and document key takeaways from every incident.
