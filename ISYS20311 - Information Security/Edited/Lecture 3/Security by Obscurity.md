# Security by Obscurity

- Reliance on *hiding design details* to protect [[Assets]]
	>*"Attackers with little knowledge can do [[Threats|little harm]]!"*
- In an INFOSEC context, hiding inner workings or [[Assets|asset]] locations
	- Underestimates an attacker's intelligence!
- Also *broadcasts vulnerability*
	- Admittance of insecurity
		>"They must have something to hide!"
- A *poor choice* for security assurance:
	- Adds little to a strong system *at best*
		- Viewed as a substitute to actual security
			>[45:29](https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1q4Ir2J8P8?start=2729&end=2751) *"We all like to make fun of [[Security by Obscurity]], right? But sometimes that's all we have."*
