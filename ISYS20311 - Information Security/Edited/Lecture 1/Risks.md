# Risks

- Potential *events* that *damage an [[Assets|asset]]*
	- Two key attributes:
		- *Likelihood*
		- *Impact*
- Risks can be controlled:
	- Involves reducing to *acceptable level*
		- *Reducing/Removing [[Vulnerabilities]]*
		- Anticipating risks
		- Insuring at-risk [[Assets]]
- Risks can *rarely be reduced to zero* - unless [[Assets|asset]] itself is removed
	- Risk mitigation is therefore a balance:
		- What can a company lose?
