# Information Assurance

- UK Cabinet Office:
	>*"The confidence that information systems will protect the information they carry and will function as they need to, when they need to, under the control of legitimate user"*

- Basically:
	- Does system protect info
		- Does it work when we need it
			- If user legitimate

- *Information Systems* are **not necessarily technical** in this context
	- Assurance made through organization-wide:
		- Policies
		- Programs
		- Documentation
		- Technical implementations
