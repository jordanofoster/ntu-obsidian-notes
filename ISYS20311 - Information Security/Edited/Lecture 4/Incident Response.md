# Incident Response

- [[Cyber Attacks|Attacks]] and breaches still happen, despite [[Risks|risk]] reduction.
	- Staff require proper training to identify *potential incidents*
		- And what to do, having *seen one*
- Responses typically include 5 phases:
	1) *Reporting*
		- Typically from *detective [[Controls|controls]]* monitored by staff - e.g. network logs
	2) *Investigation*
	3) *Assessment*
	4) *Corrective Action*
	5) *Review*

## Incident Response Planning

- Some of the following must be considered:
	- Is there an *Incident Response Team* to handle things?
		- If there is, it should contain a *cross section* of the organisation
			- This ensures *breadth of knowledge* to handle situations
	- Plans need to be *clear*
		- How is evidence recorded?
		- Is the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] being followed?
			- If not, difficulty prosecuting.
