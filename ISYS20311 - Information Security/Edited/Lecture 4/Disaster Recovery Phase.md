# Disaster Recovery Phase

- Period of time required before returning to *maximum service level*
	- Involves the following:
		- What the *Recovery Time Objective (RTO)* is:
			- *How long an organisation survives without affected assets.* ^40f09b
		- What the *Recovery Point Objection (RPO)* is
			- Typically less than [[Disaster Recovery Phase#^40f09b|RTO]] to account for complications.
- Sometimes full recovery is *impossible*
	- In this case, plans used in the [[Disaster Recovery Phase]] become permanent and integrated into normal procedure.
