# Information Security Management System (ISMS)

Simplified, ISMSs are *guidebooks* to [[Information Assurance]] within an organisation:

- Preserves [[The CIA Triad]] by applying [[Risks#^2cf679|risk-management processes]]
	- Gives confidence to *invested parties* that [[Risks]] adequately managed
- Must be integrated within organisation's processes and management structure
	- INFOSEC must be considered *throughout entire design* - including:
		- Processes,
		- Information Systems
		- Controls
